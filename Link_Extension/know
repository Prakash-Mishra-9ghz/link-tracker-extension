ðŸŽ‰ Just completed my first Chrome Extension project! ðŸš€
I built a Links Tracker extension that saves and organizes URLs, and allows users to easily manage their links. This project taught me a lot about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Chrome Extension development.
Check it out here: [GitHub Link]
Looking forward to adding more features in the future! #ChromeExtension #WebDevelopment #JavaScript #FirstProject
